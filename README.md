######out.svg
The graph generated by first-order Markov chain construction from `meat`.
Rendered with GraphViz.

####Compiling
Tested and working with g++ 4.8.2 or clang++ 3.2-11 and Boost 1.53.
Does *not* work with g++ 4.7.2.

To compile 1-markov.cpp simply run `make`.
To add edge output in GraphViz format, append `-DGRAPHVIZ` to the `CXX_FLAGS` line in `makefile`.

####Running
`./1-markov.out <sentences=1>`
The program takes the number of sentences to be generated as the only argument.
Input is captured and used in Markov chain construction until EOF.

An example of generating 5 sentences using `meat` as a corpus would be `./1-markov.out 5 < meat`
